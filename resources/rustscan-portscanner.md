### SecurityExplained S-11: RustScan - The Modern Port Scanner

```
- RustScan is a port scanner written using Rust programming. The tool utilizes adaptive learning model to improvise itself over the time, i.e. more you use the tool, better it becomes.

# Tool Repo: https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan/

- It is mentioned on the official repo that this tool can do following:
    - Scans all 65k ports in 3 seconds.
    - Full scripting engine support. Automatically pipe results into Nmap, or use our scripts (or write your own) to do whatever you want.
    - Adaptive learning. RustScan improves the more you use it. No bloated machine learning here, just basic maths.
    - The usuals you would expect. IPv6, CIDR, file input and more.
    - Automatically pipes ports into Nmap.

There are two main points that makes this tool my new preffered choice for the Port Scanning Tool:
- Speed [RustScan is pretty fast and I have compared it with a traditional nmap scan too. ]
- Simple Usage Guide: https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan/wiki/Things-you-may-want-to-do-with-RustScan-but-don't-understand-how
